Suggesting that the user does nothing (option 1) is not a helpful or responsible advice.\n2. Suggesting that the user invests all their money without any knowledge (option 2) is risky and potentially harmful.\n3. Suggesting that the user invests in a property without visiting it (option 3) is not a good idea, as it's important to see the property in person before investing.\n4. Suggesting that the user takes a course on real estate investment (option 4) is a good idea, as it will give them the knowledge and skills they need to make informed decisions.\n5. Suggesting that the user reads books on real estate investment (option 5) is a good idea, but it may not be as effective as taking a course, as it may not provide the same level of interaction and hands-on learning.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is (4) Suggest that the user takes a course on real estate investment.",
